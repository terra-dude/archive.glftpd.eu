# This script chooses which zipscript whould be run on an uploaded file

#  should be set as your zipscript, and you should set the various
#  sections in the $TREE vars, and the zipscripts that should run in
#  the corresponding sections in the matching $ZS variable.

# First match is used, so put more specific dirs on top
# If you are not using any of the TREEs, set their value to something bogus.
