Jehsom's mp3links
-----------------

This program is for use on mp3 sites. It goes through every release on the
site, and creates a very nice looking and easily navigable index of these
releases, by creating symlinks in the directories you specify.

You should configure the script by modifying the settings near the top, and
then place the script in root's crontab so it runs once a day or so:
    
    20 04 * * *     /glftpd/bin/mp3links.cron

Make sure mp3info by Cedric Tefft is in root's path when this script runs, or
else modify the script to use the full path to mp3info.

The GROUP linking looks at the portion of the release directory after the last
'-', and categorizes the release in that directory. So a rls named Hey_You-FOO
would be indexed in your GROUP_DIR (see the configuration in the script) under
the subdirectory FOO.

The GENRE linking requires mp3info by Cedric Tefft. It finds an mp3 in each of
the rls directories, and links the rls's into the appropriate genre directory
under your GENRE_DIR, or "Unknown" if the genre could not be extracted.

The ALPHA linking looks at the name of the rls dir, and indexes it under your
ALPHA_DIR. It first creates a subdir for the first letter of the rls, then
places the rls link under that. So for example, the Hey_You-FOO rls mentioned
above would be linked to by $ALPHA_DIR/H/Hey_You-FOO.  If a rls name starts
with VA-, VA_, Various, etc., it will be filed under a directory called
"Various" rather than "V", as the V folder will otherwise become cluttered :)

I hope you enjoy this script. If you have trouble with it, email me at
jehsom@jehsom.com, or catch me on EFnet as jehsom, in #glftpd.
