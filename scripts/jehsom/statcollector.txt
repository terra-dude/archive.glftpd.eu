# statcollector is a crontabbed script that should be run right before mid-
#   night. It collects all weektop and traffic stats for your site, and 
#   neatly logs this information in a directory hierarchy of your choice.
#   This is great for siteops who need end-of-week stats, etc., but fre-
#   quently are not around at the end of the week to check stats manually.
# This program requires that ncftp be on your computer. It uses it to log
#   into the site to retrieve the site traffic statistics. The "stats" pro-
#   gram is required to retrieve weektop stats. 
# Place this script in your glftpd bin dir, and enter it into the crontab 
#   of a user who has write access to your STATSDIR (preferrably root):
#
#       59 23 * * *     /glftpd/bin/statcollector
#
