#
# This script should be run nightly in root's crontab, with the -u option.
#   this will make sure that the list of files on your site is always up-
#   to date. An example crontab entry would be:
#
#       15 04 * * *     /usr/sbin/chroot /glftpd /bin/locate -u
#
# This script should also be implemented as "SITE LOCATE" on your ftp site,
#   by placing the following lines in your glftpd.conf:
#   
#       site_cmd LOCATE         EXEC    /bin/locate
#       custom-locate           *
#
# The SITE LOCATE command must be followed by a regular expression to
#   match. Filenames matching this regex will be shown.
#
# The name of the file to use as our locate database
DBFILE="/etc/locate.db"
# This is the location (relative to rootpath) that should appear
#  as the root path when returning search results. Usually /site.
SITEROOT="/site"
# Extended Regular expression that matches all dirs to exclude.
# THIS MUST BE AN EXTENDED REGULAR EXPRESSION, not wildcards, etc!
EXCLUDE_REGEX="^/Requests_Filled/(Jehsom|Blah)"
# Put "-type f" to index only files, "-type d" to index only dirs, or
# comment out the line altogether to find dirs AND files.
TYPE="-type f"
