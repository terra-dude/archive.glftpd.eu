#
# This dirscript is primarily for mp3 sites. It allows the siteop to
#   prevent certain types of releases from ever being uploaded by not
#   allowing the user to create the directory in the first place. It
#   is very powerful, allowing restrictions by rls date, rls group,
#   name format, and can disallow live rels, rels already in the dupe
#   log, and rels already existing in your site's PRE directories (to
#   prevent racing of PREs.
#
# Changes 1.4 -> 1.4.1:
#   * "sample" dirs are no longer checked against the dupe DB (like cd[1-9]).
#
# Explanation of configuration options:
# -------------------------------------
# NOCHECK_TREES - Don't process new dirs under these directory hier-
#	archies. Multiple hierarchies should be space delimited.
# DAYSBACK - Number of days back to check with regular dupechecking.
#	If ANALDUPECHECK=1, set this low, as it's quite slow.
# BANNED - Names of groups whose releases aren't allowed (space delim).
# ANALDUPECHECK - 1/0 Check thru entire SITE DUPE db to make sure the dir
#	being created is DEFINITELY not a dupe. Very fast.
# DATAPATH - glftpd's datapath, as listed in glftpd.conf
# ALLOWPARENS - Allow dirnames to start with "("
# RIAA_UNDERSCORES - Tries to disallow Names.Like--This.Name-FOO as
#	the RIAA specs say that Names_Must-Be_Like-THIS
# RIAA_NAMELENGTH - Enforces the RIAA 64-char max dirname length
# ALLOWED_YEARS - Disallows directories not containing the 4-digit year 
#	number or one of several permutations of the last 2 digits and
#	punctuation (e.g. *-99*, *.99*, *99.*, *99-*, *99####*, *####99*,
#	etc.) It is very intelligent. I suggest you try it out. Multiple
#	allowed years should be space delimited.
# AFFILS - Space delimited list of groups allowed to break the banned years
#	rules. For this to work, the new dir's name must end in "-GRP", 
#	where GRP is the group you have specified here.
# LOGFILE - Logs the denied MKDIR requests, and lists the reason and
#	user who tried to create the directory. Make sure the file is
#	world writable (chmod 666) so this can work.
# LIVE_OK - 1/0 Whether to allow Live releases from non-affils
# PRE_DIRS - If a rls is already here, its creation will be prevented.
