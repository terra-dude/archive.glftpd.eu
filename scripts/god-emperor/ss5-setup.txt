PREWORD
     Before you start getting heavy into config, you'll need to grab
     a few things (if you haven't already):

     zipscript-c 0.6+ by Dark0n3
     --> http://kotisivu.raketti.net/darkone/project-zs/project-zs-022302.tgz
     (it will have to be compiled with the custom zsconfig.h in ss-local.zip)

     gl pass verifier by Usurper *NOW INCLUDED IN SS-LOCAL PACK*
     --> http://usurper.eroded.org/glpassver.tgz
     (make sure passwd file path in the .c points to /etc/passwd and compile)

     Sitestat 5.0 runs in 2 parts, a local bot and a remote bot, the local bot
     would reside on the ftp box, it has to be eggdrop 1.65+ with tcl 8.3+,
     the remote bot can be a win or *nix egg, as long as it also is 1.65+ with
     tcl 8.3+ .... they only have to be linked, NOT sharing userfile ....

     A full setup guide will come soon...


GLFTPD.CONF
     Some settings have to be appended to the conf to make everything work,
     zipscript-c will have some entries to add as well so check its readme:

   site_cmd AUTHPASS       EXEC    /bin/glpassver
   site_cmd INVITE         EXEC    /bin/ss-inv.tcl
   site_cmd TRIAL          EXEC    /bin/ss-trial.tcl
   site_cmd VIEWTRIAL      EXEC    /bin/ss-trial.tcl view
   site_cmd TOTAL          EXEC    /bin/du -ks
   custom-total 1 7
   custom-viewtrial  !8 *
   custom-trial     1
   custom-invite   !8 *
   custom-authpass !8 1 =SITEBOT


INSTALLING #1: COMMANDS
     If you understand what has to be done from the above section great, you
     can skip this one.. if you aren't sure heres what has to be done:

     1. copy 'du' to gl's bin dir, chmod it 755

     2. edit 'ss-inv.tcl' then copy it to gl's bin dir, chmod it 755

     3. edit 'ss-trial.tcl' then copy it to gl's bin dir, chmod it 4755

     4. make a 'sitestat' dir inside the main glftpd dir, chmod it 666

     5. compile glpassver.c after changing the passwd path to '/etc/passwd'
        chmod 755 if necessary, copy to gl's bin dir

     6. make sure libtcl8.3.so libtclstub8.3.a librt.so.1 libm.so.6
        are in gl's lib dir... and world readable (files might differ for 8.4)

     7. make sure 'tclsh' is in gl's bin dir and chmodded 755


INSTALLING #2: LOCAL (ss-local.zip)
     Get an egg, crack it, let it fall into either the 'sitestat' or 'sitebot'
     dir inside glftpd's main dir... Sitestat's local script 'ss5-local.tcl' 
     now has to be extracted there also - yes the main egg dir - and must be
     edited, theres a few important options to set, like the botnet name of
     the remote bot, the bouncers if you have any and such, all simple stuff.

     Add 'source ss5-local.tcl' to the egg conf

     If you are unsure how to link bots or have fears regarding a dynamic ip
     or anything else like security, heres a few pointers:

     * when bots are set to link, as long as one of them has a static hostname
       the other can link to it

     * if the local bot does not need to be on irc, its better if it isn't, 
       to accomplish this just do not load the IRC module in the egg conf


INSTALLING #3: REMOTE (ss-main.zip)
     The second eggdrop running somewhere not on the ftp box, for security as
     well as performance reasons has to be as free of work as possible, so if
     you want it as part of a botnet fine, just don't load things like netbots
     or rupt scripts, it is recommended you use getops in that case..

     Extract ss-main.zip to the main egg dir, you will see a few tcl and .cfg
     files, yes many people think its messy this way but you have to do it!

     * it is possible the remote bot will kick the local bot for flooding, to
       prevent this, 'set dcc-flood-thr 200' in the remote egg's conf

     Order of operations:

     1. at the end of your egg conf, add: 'source ss5-main.tcl' without quotes

     2. edit 'ss5-main.tcl' and read all the comments before changing options

     3. edit 'ss5.cfg' and read all the comments before adding, changing

     4. if you want to load jackjack, add 'source jackjack.tcl' after the line
        for ss5-main.tcl in the egg conf

     5. some skins are provided as of RC2, make sure you have the preferred 
        one defined in ss-main (where reversi used to be), to have seperate
        skins for any particular areas you simply need to make a copy of the
        file and name it <areaname>_skin.cfg e.g: MP3_skin.cfg


AFTERWORD
     Failure to do the above instructions or deciding you know better and doing
     it all your own way will likely result in errors all over, and a basically
     useless setup... you have been warned
