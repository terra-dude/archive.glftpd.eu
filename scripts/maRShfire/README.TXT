Description:

GlFTPdWatcher is a small FREEWARE tool to help you handle the SITE commands of the »glFTPd ftp demon, which is maybe
the best ftpd software out there for Linux and other Unixes. As far as I know, all current commands are supported by
the program und put together in logical groups. As user of this program you don't have to know the correct syntax for
the commands. Simply select the task you want to do and supply the parameters. 
Note: This is no ftp client! You can not download or upload files with it! It is just for administrative purposes.
