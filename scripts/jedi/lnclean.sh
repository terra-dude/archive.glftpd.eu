# Script name: lnclean (link cleaner) v1.00
# Author: [Jedi] (jedi_il@hotmail.com)
# Description:
# This is a link cleaner for glftpd sites, on some zipscripts, links are being created to incomplete
# directories, where ppl and quickly enter and upload files, unfortunately, if zipscript not
# fully configured, or fucks up (rarely), it leavs broken links which cant be deleted from the
# ftp itself (as far as i know...) so this little proggie can be run from a site command in glftpd
# or from crontab (or both) to clean current directory, or the entire /site tree of broken links
# it wont del un-broken links so nothing to worry about :)

# 3) edit the /etc/glftpd.conf file
